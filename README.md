# HUST.AIA.BCI

Here is the course design program for HUST.AIA.BCI, with the title named "SSVEP Classification in Untrained Scenarios".

The repository includes the replication of the CCA[[1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4015614)] and the FBCCA[[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26035476/#:~:text=By%20incorporating%20the%20fundamental%20and%20harmonic%20SSVEP%20components,facilitates%20its%20practical%20applications%20such%20as%20high-speed%20spelling.)] in MATLAB. 

The dataset is provided by Professor [Dongrui Wu](https://lab.bciml.cn/en/members/).
